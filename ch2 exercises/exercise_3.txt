int a(2.5); -> that's a float
char z(500) is wrong -> char only takes string input
double he's(1.2E+5); -> no quote-strings in variable definition
const long large; -> have to add value
char c('\''); -> too many quotes

line 5 is wrong. my reasoning was wrong, it's allowed.

int big = 40000; is technically valid but on 16-bit systems that doesn't work (2^15=32768 < 40000)
float val = 12345.12345; is also wrong -> accuracy of floats is only 6 digits.

TOTAL SCORE = 4/6
