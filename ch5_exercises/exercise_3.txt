The int variable x contains the number 7. Calculate the value of the following
logical expressions:

a. x < 10 && x >= â€“1

true -> 7 is less than 10 and greater than -1

b. !x && x >= 3

false -> !x would be 0 right which is false and because it's and, automatically whole statement is false

c. x++ == 8 || x == 7

true -> first is wrong, second is right. first is wrong since x++ would still be 7

i got this wrong. remember that ++ (postfix) is a delayed update. so x++ shows 7 in console but is actualy 8. therefore, 8 != 7 making it false
