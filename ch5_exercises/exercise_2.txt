a. How are operands and operators in the following expression associated?
x = –4 * i++ – 6 % 4;



Insert parentheses to form equivalent expressions.

x = (–4 * i++) – (6 % 4);

b. What value will be assigned in part a to the variable x if the variable i has a
value of –2?

x = –4 * (-2)++ – 6 % 4;
  = -4 * -2 - 2
  = 6
