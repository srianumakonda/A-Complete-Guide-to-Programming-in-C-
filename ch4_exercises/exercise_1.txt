EXERCISE: figure out what the output is of the given code.

given code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    double x = 12.0;
    cout.precision(2); // Precision 2
    cout << " By default: " << x << endl;
    cout << " showpoint: " << showpoint << x << endl;
    cout << " fixed: " << fixed << x << endl;
    cout << " scientific: " << scientific << x << endl;
    return 0;
}

what's the output:

By default:    12
 showpoint:    12
 fixed:        12.00
 scientific:   1.2e+1  

technically, got 2/4 right. didn't put the decimal at the showpoint because i made the assumption that it would round to 12 [just like default]. 
also didn't know that scientific notation also followed the precision thing, based on decimals. because i thought it was 1.2 (which was 2), id be fine. but I was wrong here and it should've been 1.20
